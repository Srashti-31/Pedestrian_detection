SOCIAL-DISTANCING: Developed a model using HOG Classifier in python to identify if two individuals are not maintaining the required distance between them.
Green rectangle shows that the required distance is maintained and Red rectangle shows that required distance is not maintained.

This project was helpful during the covid times when social distancing was important. In some countries, the government installed the security camera on the street and the virtual machine used to warn people if social distancing was not maintained.
